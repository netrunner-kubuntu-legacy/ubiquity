ubiquity (patched version for netrunner)
========
update https://github.com/netrunner/ubiquity to latest version (Kubuntu 14.04) **[done]**

* Keyboard: kubuntu 14.04 ubiquity has the "keyboard language dropdown glitch" fixed, should be fixed then with update to latest version, as it is still there in build1 ubiquity [seems not be fixed upstream]
* **[done]** Prepare: hide/remove the two selectable options (3rd party and download additional)
* **[done]** Disk Setup: Auto-Partition shows "Kubuntu" partition to be installed, should be named "Netrunner"
